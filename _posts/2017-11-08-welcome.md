  A collective blog for a collection of nerds.

This blog is the collaboration of UC Irvine Computer Science graduates: Alexander Thompson, Brett Settle, Nicholas Prendergast, and John Thorpe.
We created Team Babylon to talk about personal projects and hobbies, and hopefully motivate future group projects.
